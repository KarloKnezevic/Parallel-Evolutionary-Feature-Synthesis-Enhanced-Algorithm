# Parallel EFS Enhanced Algorithm
Parallel Evolutionary Feature Synthesis Enhanced Algorithm

EFS is a regression algorithm that outputs accurate, readable, nonlinear models. 
FS relies on the assumption that the functions h_m(X)   introduced in the expression above can be optimized by evolutionary computation.
